Hello, my name is Bui Duc Thinh and this is project I spent few days to do.
It is an incomplete chat app that can let user do followings:
-  Sign in with under your name
-  Create a chat room
- Invite another user to your chat room
- Chat realtime
- Send a file in your chat box
- Makeing video conference in that room

Sadly, I cant make it better and be fully feature as I hope due to first time interact with socket.io and webrtc. However it is easy to build up more feature or decorate user interface if neccessary.
Finallly, I hope you find this small project as good for a test result. Thank you! ❤️
